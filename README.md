People want me to write a README file for the plugin, so I guess I will

Installation/Configuration:  
1. Copy snip.jar into your bungeecord plugins folder  
2. Run your server, this will automatically write a default configuration  
3. Edit the configuration files to your heart's content  
4. Reload the plugin  

You are now operational.

Also there is the whole license thing. It basically goes like this:  
1. Use the software at your own risk, any harm that it does is your fault.  
2. Copy this software as you want, you just have to give me credit for it

This software officially uses the MIT Source License
